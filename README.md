<h1>üëã Hi, my name is Airoaei Catalin and I am a 25 years old programming enthusiast</h1>
<p>
The passion for web development arose from my university days at UTCN, there I have studied Computer Science, so I got to know computers pretty well as a whole, as I have studied all kinds of topics such as AI, Image Processing, Computer Graphics and Interactive Systems, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Arduino and also other very intriguing subjects. Even though all these aforementioned topics sound very interesting, the one that intrigued me the most was web development, hence I decided I want to improve and learn new technologies that can help me develop beautiful and intriguing web applications. I like paying attention even to the smallest details, I like building my apps simple but good looking and modern. I like challanges and am always eager to accumulate more knowledge as I can adapt with ease at new situations.

<h1> üíº  Previous experience: </h1>
I have worked 10 months as a System Integrator and also a little bit as an Embedded C developer at Magneti Marelli in Cluj-Napoca, where I have learned how to work and communicate with other people.
Developed AGILE skills and learned to use tools such as JIRA as well as a lot of Git branching and merging, and managing knowledge.
- Took care of daily deliveries of Software Product
- Used GIT as versioning tool
- Created automatization scripts in Bash and Python

<h3>Currently studying at Codecool Academy!</h3>


- üî≠ As for the moment, I am working on **Best auto deals app** which is an app where you can trade used cars.

- üå± The technologies I'm currently using but also at the same time learning are **Java, html5, css3, javascript, postgresql, react.js, Spring Boot, Spring Security, typescript**

		‚ö†Ô∏èNotes‚ö†Ô∏è
  </h2>


- **Due to a small bug(I didn't set my global email in github from the terminal and my mail address was set on private, all my commits from codecool don't appear, that's why I have almost no commits in 2021(I have to amend all 1000 commits manually and to change the author for each from <Catalin@MacBook-Air-Catalin.local> into Airoaei Catalin <airoaei.catalin@gmail.com>, I used SSH so that's why I could work on my repos even if I did not have my email set). The repos are private but i will start cloning the important ones now that I solved the issue. I should have somewhere around 800-1000 commits since 2021.**

- **I will keep adding to git what I continue working but also some old projects of mine that I didn't use github for versioning, some of them can be found on my bitbucket and some I will constantly add them to git. So be sure to check out my profile constantly.**
